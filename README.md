# Tkinter-tic-tac-toe
We provide a tic-tac-toe GUI in the Tkinter python module, and we use python 3.8.
This is a pretty simple project and mainly a fun way to learn about the Tkinter module.

To run the program on your desktop you will need to have Tkinter installed.  I made sure to explain any of the more complicated steps in functions, 
but aside from that I believe everything is pretty self-explanatory once you learn the basics of Tkinter.
